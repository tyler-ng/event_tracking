## System Architecture

Our event tracking system is designed to handle millions of users with a focus on:

1. **Scalability** - Able to process high volumes of events efficiently
2. **Reliability** - Fault-tolerant with data buffering during high traffic
3. **Flexibility** - Customizable event schema and feature flags
4. **Performance** - Fast data retrieval through aggregation and caching

## Key Components

- **Event Capture API** - Endpoints for receiving events from client applications
- **Session Management** - Tracking user session activity and duration
- **Feature Flags** - A/B testing and feature rollout control
- **Background Processing** - Asynchronous event processing with Celery
- **Data Aggregation** - Pre-computed aggregates for dashboard performance
- **Admin Interface** - Visualization and management tools
